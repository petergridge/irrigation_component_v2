# Irrigation Component V2
The driver for this project is to provide an easy to configure user interface for the gardener of the house. The goal is that once the inital configuration is done all the features can be modified through lovelace cards. To further simplify things there are conditions in the Lovelace example to hide the configuration items.

All the inputs of the new platforms are Home Assistant entities for example the start time is provided via a input_datetime entity. The information is used to define a template internally that is evaluated to trigger the irrigate action according to the inputs provided.

Watering can occur in an Eco mode where a water/wait/repeat cycle is run to minimise run off by letting water soak as a by using several short watering cycles. The wait and repeat configuration is optional if you only want to water for a single lengthy period of time.

The rain sensor is implemented as a binary_sensor, this allows a practically any combination of sensors to suspend the irrigation. Additionally being implemented as a switch you can start a program or zone based manually or using an automation. There is also the ability to ignore the rain sensor at the program or zone level so sheltered areas can be watered even if the rain sensor has been activated.

Only one program or zone can run at a time to prevent multiple solenoids being activated. If program start times result in an overlap the running program will be stopped.

Manually starting a program by turning the switch on will not evaluate the rain sensor, as there is an assumption that there is an intent to run the program or zone.

The solution is two custom components implemeting new switch platform types:
* irrigationprogram - to represent a program
  - The irrigation entity stores the last run day.
  - The list of zones to run in this program.
  - binary sensor definition for a rain sensor
* irrigationzone - to represent zones
  - The irrigation_zone provides the link to a switch entity to control a solenoid.
  - The length of time to water.
  - Has attribute defining remaining run time.

## INSTALLATION
### To create a working sample
* Copy the irrigationprogram and irrigationzone folders to the ‘config/custom components/’ directory 
* Copy the 'irrigation.yaml' file to the packages directory or into configuration.yaml. Sample configuration
* Copy the 'dummy_switches.yaml' file to the packages directory of into configuration yaml. This will provide dummy implementation of switches to represent solenoids.
* Restart Home Assistant
* In Lovelace create a 'manual' card and copy the contents of the 'lovelace.yaml' file
### Important
* Make sure that all of the objects you reference i.e. input_boolean, switch etc are defined or you may get errors.
### Pre-requisite
* The time_date integration is required
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: time_date
    display_options:
      - 'time'
      - 'date'
```
### Testing
* When the program is first set up the last_ran attribute is set to today so if you are using the frequency option it won’t run until the next day. You can use the developer tools to modify the attribute for testing.
### Debug
Add the following to your logger section configuration.yaml
```yaml
logger:
    default: warning
    logs:
        custom_components.irrigationprogram: debug
        custom_components.irrigationzone: debug
```

## CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

## program
*(string)(Required)* the switch entity.
#### friendly_name
*(string)(Required)* This is the name given to the irrigation entity.
#### start_time
*(template)(Required)* Allows a value template to define when watering occurs on the program. Watering will occur when the template evaluates to True.

##### run_freq (mutually exclive with run_days)
*(input_select)* A numeric value that represent the frequency to water, 1 is daily, 2 is every second day and so on.
##### run_days (mutually exclusive with run_freq)
*(input_select)* The selected option should provide a list days to run, 'Sun','Thu' will run on Sunday and Thursday
#### irrigation_on
*(input_boolean)(Optional)* Attribute to temporarily disable the watering schedule
#### rain_sensor
*(binary_sensor)(Optional)* Any binary sensor - True or On will prevent the irrigation starting
#### ignore_rain_sensor
*(input_boolean)(Optional)* Attribute to allow the schedule to run regardless of the state of the rain sensor - True or On will result in the rain sensor being ignored
#### icon
*(icon)(Optional)*
#### Zones 
*(list)(Required)* the list of zones to water.
  #### zone
  *(entity)(Required)* This is the name given to the irrigation_zone entity.
  #### ignore_rain_sensor (mutually exclusive with ignore_rain_bool)
  *(input_boolean)(Optional)* Attribute to allow the schedule to run regardless of the state of the rain sensor - True or On will result in the rain sensor being ignored.
  #### ignore_rain_bool (mutually exclusive with ignore_rain_sensor)
  *(boolean)(Optional)* Attribute to allow the schedule to run regardless of the state of the rain sensor - True or On will result in the rain sensor being ignored

#### water
*(input_number)(Required)* This it the period that the zone will turn the switch_entity on for.

#### icon_wait
*(icon)(Optional)* This will replace the default icon mdi:timer-sand.
#### unique_id
*(string)(Optional)* An ID that uniquely identifies this switch. Set this to an unique value to allow customisation trough the UI.

* ESP8266 
* PCF8575 - I2C IO expander for up to 16 solenoids
* BME280 - temperature, pressure and humidity sensor
* Moisture Sensor - analogue/digital moisture sensor

## REVISION HISTORY
